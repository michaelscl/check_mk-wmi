check_mk-wmi
============

Provides a WMI agent for Check_MK. It consists of the check_mk-agent.wmi agent with plugins and checks for wmic_df and wmic_services.  The plugins assume that wmic is on the PATH. It can be downloaded <a href='ftp://ftp.pbone.net/mirror/ftp.sourceforge.net/pub/sourceforge/p/pa/pandora/Tools%20and%20dependencies%20(All%20versions)/RPM%20CentOS,%20RHEL/wmic-4.0.0SVN-2.1.el5.centos.noarch.rpm'>here</a> from rpm.pbone.net. The individual agent and check files can be copied to the appropriate Check_MK directories in your install, or you can install using the packages/wmi-0.2.mkp package. If you have any questions please email me at dlittle@toyatech.net.

Thanks and enjoy!
